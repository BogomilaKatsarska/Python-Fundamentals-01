# A list is a collection which is index supported and changeable(mutable).
# It allows duplicate members.
# In Python lists are written in square brackets.
# They can expand and shrink.

# You can use the 'split' function to split a string and create a list

# some_text = "a b c d"
# my_list = some_text.split(" ")
# print(my_list)

# some_text = ["Hello", "World"]
# result = ', '.join(some_text)
# print(result)

# Unpacking Elements in List
# nums = [20, 5, 2]
# print(*nums)

# result = [1, 2]
# result.append(5)
# print(result)
# result.remove(1)
# print(result)

# pop(0) removes the element on the 0 index or if no argument - pops last el

# .sort() - method that sorts from smallest to largest value in the list
